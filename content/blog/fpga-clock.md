I have recently been learning how to use and apply FPGAs. I have some new old tubes coming, this time VFDs, and the obvious project is a clock. I have implemented a clock before, though it was with an MSP430, this time I have decided to implement a clock using an FPGA. I've had the board sitting around for a while so it was time I finally did something. Currently I have the basic logic implemented, but as I don't have the displays here can't implement the multiplexing functionality. The HDL is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/benpye/verilog-clock).
