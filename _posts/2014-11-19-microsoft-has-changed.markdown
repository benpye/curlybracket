When I switched to Arch Linux as my primary operating system about a year ago I did this not because Windows itself was bad, but because it made my work flow better, embedded development was easier, most software I used was open source, it was good. A year later I'm now back on Windows and about to buy a Surface Pro 3, Microsoft has changed and it's good.

This really started with the Windows Technical Preview, Microsoft released a version of Windows earlier than they ever had done before (M1 apparently - the Windows 8 developer preview was M3 for comparison). This was a great move for them, it allowed for better feedback, earlier in the development process. If they use this well I believe that Windows 10 will be the best version of Windows to date. They've already been making changes based upon the feedback received and if this continues, it'll be fantastic.

Rewind one week to their Connect() event. They announce something huge, .NET is going open source, this is game changing. The company that before relied on vendor lock in is now opening their tools and their platform. Not only that, but Visual Studio Community is announced, a free version (effectively pro previously) that is available for any individual, OSS project or even small business to use. Finally, in the 2015 preview they add support for Android for C++ and announce that later iOS will be supported.

Together, these changes have made me realise that whilst the Linux community is strong, Microsoft are really trying to be developer friendly. They've convinced me once again that Windows is the better platform for development, and after using Visual Studio again I do wonder why I switched away to an extent. Already impressed by the changes, after submitting feedback relating to Visual Studio 2015 Preview, I actually got into contact with the VC++ team. I got to talk via Lync about the platform, and they were very understanding to the problems that a developer aiming for all these different platforms faces. I now have someone there I can reach out too, which is great.

Next week I hope to buy a Surface Pro 3. Yet another great Microsoft product. With 10% off for students the device is great, and hopefully it'll last me a good few years. I now have no issue with supporting Windows, they really have won me back. Thanks Linux, you have your place, my servers aren't changing any time soon, but Windows once again has my desktop and soon to be notebook.
